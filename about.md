<p>S1 was a non-profit artist-run center for contemporary art in Portland, Oregon. It was founded in 2014 by Alex Ian Smith, Felisha Ledesma, and Erik Carlson. All three served as co-directors. Erik Carlson left the organization in 2017, while Felisha and Alex continued until 2019. In 2021 S1 was officially renamed "Synth Library Portland."</p>

<p>This partial archive documents this time-period from 2014 - 2019. Some Documentation is incomplete. Some Documentation got lost. Some things never got documented in the first place.</p>

<p>At the moment, this archive is focused on the visual-art component of S1's programming. By 2019 S1's programming had begun to shift away from visual art, so there were no exhibitions in 2019 before Felisha and Alex departed.</p>
