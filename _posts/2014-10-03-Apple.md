“We have sacrificed the old immaterial gods, and now we are occupying the temple of the Market-God.”

Have you found some things to spend your fortune on yet?

Carly and Rebecca consider the decorative other object, which serves minimal function in day-to-day life but retains rich history and visual impact, as it converses with impending commodification and attempts to actuate a new perspective onto its confinement within capitalism. If decorative objects and images can resist commodification by preemptively exploiting themselves, then have they achieved a successful measure of autonomy? Otherwise, how might they quickly absorb their context and become metaphors for a social state in which all resources – creative, life-giving, elite, et al. – are submerged in the trade market?
