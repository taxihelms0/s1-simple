Ornamental Hypergate Conglomerate
Birch Cooper
April 29, 2016

Ornamental Hypergate Conglomerate is a generative electronic system that outputs light and sound. In this installation, conglomerations of digital logic gates being run as analog circuits in feedback systems comprise the score of a musical composition. The forms produced are spread across four loudspeakers in a structure that points to a square unfolding into a tesseract. Sound is used as a hyperspatial sculptural medium that reveals its form through iteration.

Birch Cooper is an artist, electronic musician and electronic instrument builder based in Portland, OR. His work centers around integrated systems and creative collaboration. He is a founding member of the art collectives MSHR and Oregon Painting Society as well as many other musical groups. Since 2007 Cooper has installed interactive and generative electronic systems extensively in Europe and the US with MSHR and OPS. Ornamental Hypergate Conglomerate is his first solo exhibition of a generative system.
