The Scenario Of Work is a series of oil paintings that contrast abstraction with stark figurative elements. Most questions are left unanswered, not for lack of answers, but because the deeper you delve the more abstract the metaphors become until all that is left for explanation is instinct, intuition, and an honest appreciation for the absurdity of life.
