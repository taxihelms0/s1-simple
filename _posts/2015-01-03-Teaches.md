S1 is proud to present “Teaches a Rainbow” by Derek Corns. This will be Corns’ first exhibition with the gallery. The show includes mixed media paintings, site-responsive installations, plastic sculptures, drawings, photographs, and ceramics – each made during a significant period of recent life events that shifted the artist’s perception.

Through the lens of desire, Corns references loss, sex, transformation, mythology, and humor. Materially, this is communicated through the manipulation of plastic sheets, marbleized paint, appropriated imagery, reference to kinky objects such as nylon rope and chain, the heaviness and lightness of textiles, as well as ceramics and readymades. Corns believes the color spectrum is “the most beautiful thing in the world” and upholds the notion that it functions as a visual tool of optimism.

Derek Corns lives and works in Los Angeles. He will receive his BFA from the New Genres department at Otis College of Art and Design in spring 2015. This show marks a return to Portland for Corns, where he lived from 2007-2011.
