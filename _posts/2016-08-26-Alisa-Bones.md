During the month of August, S1 has had the pleasure of working with artist-in-residence Alisa Bones. While in residence, Bones has created a series of process-driven paintings that incorporate and pull from her own digital archive of found and collected imagery. This archive, which is an ongoing project for Bones, is comprised of book scans, cell phone pictures, found digital images, and drawings. In Father’s of Abstraction, images of geology textbooks, Romantics, and cave paintings are juxtaposed to propose new ways of thinking about history and the individual’s relationship to it.

Alisa Bones is an artist living and working in Brooklyn, NY. She has recently shown at Abrons Art Center in Manhatthan, Semantics in Cincinatti, and in Portland at PSU’s Littman Gallery and at H. Klum Fine Arts. She received her BA from Reed College and holds an MFA in Painting from Yale. In 2012 she was the recipient of a Kaspar T. Locher Fellowship. Alisa was born in Kansas City, MO and grew up in the Pacific Northwest. This is her first solo show in Portland.
