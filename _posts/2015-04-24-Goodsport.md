Debuting at S1, GoodSport launches its first complete menswear-inspired sporting goods line. Opening Thursday, April 23rd at 6:00pm, GoodSport: Game On! is simultaneously a brand launch pop-up shop and exhibition. GoodSport complicates contemporary expressions of masculinity at the confluence of aesthetics, (homo)eroticism, and practices of athletics and sport. The objects wear their constructed skin. They have a constructed body.

The debut collection of handmade leather works are constructed under environmental and social considerations similar to those imposed on the athletic, queer, male body which created them. The objects reside at the intersection of functional use, excellent performativity, and aesthetic worth.

Nicolo Gentile is an artist living and working out of Portland. He has been the Artistic Director of Goodsport since May 2014.
